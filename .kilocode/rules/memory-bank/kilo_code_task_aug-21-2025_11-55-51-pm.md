[new_task completed] Result: # AI Proxy Codebase Architecture Analysis

## Executive Summary

The AI proxy is a Go-based HTTP server that provides a unified API interface for multiple AI providers. The codebase follows a modular architecture with clean separation of concerns, though there are opportunities for optimization in concurrency patterns, error handling, and resource management.

## 1. Main Entry Point Analysis

### [`main.go`](main.go:1)
**Strengths:**
- Clean, minimal entry point with embedded configuration via `//go:embed`
- Standard library HTTP server setup
- Flag-based port configuration
- Provider-specific initialization (e.g., Gigachat client setup)

**Architecture Patterns:**
- **Embedded Assets**: Configuration embedded at build time using `//go:embed config.yaml`
- **Provider Factory**: Dynamic provider initialization based on configuration
- **Global State**: Uses global variables for `Models` and `RateLimits` maps

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Hard-coded authentication token in [`authMiddleware`](main.go:28)
- Global state management could be encapsulated in a service struct
- No graceful shutdown handling

## 2. Core Proxy Handler Analysis

### [`internal/proxy_handler.go`](internal/proxy_handler.go:1)
**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive request handling with both streaming and non-streaming support
- Intelligent model selection algorithm considering priority, rate limits, and request length
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation (sets max limits on errors)

**Performance Patterns:**
- **GJSON/SJSON Usage**: High-performance JSON manipulation without full unmarshaling
- **Streaming Support**: Efficient `io.Copy` for streaming responses
- **Request Length Optimization**: Model selection based on [`MaxRequestLength`](internal/proxy_handler.go:47) to optimize resource usage

**Concurrency Patterns:**
- **Fine-grained Locking**: Each rate limit has its own [`sync.Mutex`](internal/proxy_handler.go:35)
- **Lock-per-Resource**: Avoids global locks, enabling better concurrent access

**Areas for Improvement:**
- **Code Duplication**: Streaming and non-streaming logic is duplicated in [`HandlerTxt`](internal/proxy_handler.go:57)
- **Complex Selection Logic**: [`selectModel`](internal/proxy_handler.go:212) function has complex nested conditions
- **Error Handling**: Generic error responses, could benefit from structured error types

## 3. Provider Implementation Analysis

### Common Patterns Across Providers:

**Architectural Consistency:**
- All providers implement the [`Provider`](internal/schema/schema.go:33) interface
- Consistent constructor pattern: `NewXXXClient(url, model, token, config)`
- Centralized HTTP client creation via [`client.NewHttpClient`](internal/client/http_client.go:11)

**Provider-Specific Analysis:**

#### [`internal/gemini/client.go`](internal/gemini/client.go:1)
- **Throttling**: Global queue with [`maxTimeoutTime = 10s`](internal/gemini/client.go:21)
- **Request Transformation**: Complex OpenAI â†’ Gemini format conversion
- **Response Standardization**: Full response transformation to OpenAI format

#### [`internal/openai/client.go`](internal/openai/client.go:1)
- **Minimal Implementation**: Simplest provider, direct passthrough
- **Model Override**: Uses [`sjson.SetBytes`](internal/openai/client.go:17) to set model name

#### [`internal/gigachat/client.go`](internal/gigachat/client.go:1)
- **External SDK**: Uses [`github.com/evgensoft/gigachat`](internal/gigachat/client.go:10)
- **OAuth2 Management**: Automatic token refresh handled by SDK
- **Advanced Response Conversion**: Comprehensive OpenAI compatibility via [`convert.go`](internal/gigachat/convert.go:96)

#### [`internal/openrouter/client.go`](internal/openrouter/client.go:1)
- **Streaming Support**: Only provider with dedicated [`StreamCall`](internal/openrouter/client.go:142) method
- **Provider Headers**: Custom headers for API source identification
- **Conditional Logic**: Different handling for streaming vs non-streaming requests

## 4. HTTP Client Factory Analysis

### [`internal/client/http_client.go`](internal/client/http_client.go:1)
**Strengths:**
- Centralized configuration management
- Connection pooling with configurable parameters
- Consistent timeout handling across providers

**Configuration Options:**
- [`MaxIdleConns: 100`](internal/client/http_client.go:14) - Global connection pool
- [`MaxIdleConnsPerHost: 10`](internal/client/http_client.go:15) - Per-host limits
- Configurable [`IdleConnTimeout`](internal/client/http_client.go:16) and request timeout

**Resource Management:**
- Proper connection reuse and pooling
- Configurable timeouts prevent resource leaks

## 5. Rate Limiting Implementation

### [`RateLimit`](internal/proxy_handler.go:27) Structure Analysis
**Concurrency Pattern:**
- **Per-Model Mutexes**: Each model has independent rate limiting
- **Three-Tier Limits**: Minute/hour/day counters with separate time windows
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: All counter updates protected by mutexes

**Performance Characteristics:**
- **Time-Window Reset**: Automatic counter resets in [`updateLimitCounters`](internal/proxy_handler.go:263)
- **Lock Contention**: Minimal due to fine-grained locking strategy
- **Memory Allocation**: Efficient counter management without additional allocations

**Implementation Strengths:**
- Circuit breaker pattern via [`setMaxLimitMinute`](internal/proxy_handler.go:192)
- Automatic rate limit recovery
- Priority-based model selection

## 6. Schema and Configuration Handling

### [`internal/schema/schema.go`](internal/schema/schema.go:1)
**Interface Design:**
- Clean [`Provider`](internal/schema/schema.go:33) interface with context support
- OpenAI-compatible request/response structures
- Configurable HTTP client settings

### Configuration Architecture:
- **YAML-based**: Human-readable configuration format
- **Per-Model Settings**: Individual timeout and connection settings
- **Provider Flexibility**: Generic configuration applicable to all providers

## Current Architecture Patterns

### 1. **Plugin Architecture**
- Each provider is a separate package implementing common interface
- Easy to add new providers without modifying core logic

### 2. **Factory Pattern**
- Centralized HTTP client creation
- Provider instantiation through constructor functions

### 3. **Strategy Pattern**
- Different providers handle requests differently while maintaining common interface
- Model selection strategy based on multiple criteria

### 4. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
- Automatic error handling with rate limit penalties
- Retry mechanism with different models

## Strengths Summary

1. **Modularity**: Clean separation between providers and core logic
2. **Performance**: GJSON/SJSON for efficient JSON handling, connection pooling
3. **Concurrency**: Fine-grained locking, streaming support
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new providers
5. **Resource Management**: Proper HTTP client configuration and connection pooling
6. **Rate Limiting**: Comprehensive three-tier system with automatic recovery

## Areas for Optimization

### 1. **Error Handling**
- Implement structured error types instead of generic `fmt.Errorf`
- Add error categorization (rate limit, provider error, network error)
- Improve error context propagation

### 2. **Code Organization**
- Extract model selection logic into separate service
- Reduce code duplication in streaming/non-streaming paths
- Consider dependency injection for better testability

### 3. **Performance Optimizations**
- Pool byte buffers for request/response handling
- Implement response caching for identical requests
- Add metrics and monitoring capabilities

### 4. **Memory Allocation Patterns**
- Current implementation has minimal allocations
- Consider object pooling for high-frequency request/response objects
- Profile memory usage under load

### 5. **Concurrency Improvements**
- Consider replacing channels with sync.Pool for provider throttling
- Implement backpressure mechanisms for high load scenarios
- Add context cancellation support throughout the request pipeline

The codebase demonstrates solid architectural principles with room for enhancement in error handling, monitoring, and advanced concurrency patterns.

**User:**

[new_task completed] Result: # AI Proxy Performance Optimization Analysis

Based on comprehensive code analysis, I've identified critical performance optimization opportunities across memory allocation, concurrency, I/O, CPU operations, and resource management.

## 1. Memory Allocation Issues

### Critical Problems:
- **Double Memory Allocation** ([`proxy_handler.go:71,130,170`](internal/proxy_handler.go:71)): Request bodies are read with `io.ReadAll` and response bodies are read again for non-streaming responses
- **Unnecessary String Conversions** ([`proxy_handler.go:408,324`](internal/proxy_handler.go:408)): `strings.TrimSpace(string(resp))` and logging operations create temporary strings
- **Response Buffer Duplication** ([`proxy_handler.go:428`](internal/proxy_handler.go:428)): `bytes.NewReader(resp)` creates unnecessary buffer copy
- **JSON Processing Allocations** ([`gemini/client.go:98,221`](internal/gemini/client.go:98)): Multiple marshal/unmarshal operations without reuse

### Optimization Opportunities:
1. **Implement sync.Pool for Buffers**:
   ```go
   var bufferPool = sync.Pool{
       New: func() interface{} {
           return make([]byte, 0, 4096)
       },
   }
   ```

2. **Stream Processing**: Replace `io.ReadAll` with streaming parsers for large payloads
3. **Reuse JSON Decoders**: Pool `json.Decoder` instances instead of creating new ones

**Potential Impact**: 30-50% reduction in memory allocations, reduced GC pressure

## 2. Concurrency Bottlenecks

### Critical Problems:
- **Global Queue Serialization** ([`gemini/client.go:18`](internal/gemini/client.go:18), [`gigachat/client.go:15`](internal/gigachat/client.go:15), [`groq/client.go:17`](internal/groq/client.go:17)): Each provider uses `make(chan interface{}, 1)` forcing sequential execution
- **Lock Contention** ([`proxy_handler.go:227,253`](internal/proxy_handler.go:227)): `selectModel` locks individual rate limits in loop, potential deadlocks
- **Blocking Sleep Operations** ([`gemini/client.go:129`](internal/gemini/client.go:129)): `time.Sleep()` blocks goroutines instead of using timers

### Optimization Opportunities:
1. **Replace Global Queues with Rate Limiters**:
   ```go
   // Use golang.org/x/time/rate or token bucket per model
   rateLimiter := rate.NewLimiter(rate.Every(10*time.Second), 1)
   ```

2. **Lock-Free Rate Limiting**: Use `sync/atomic` for counters where possible
3. **Async Timeouts**: Replace `time.Sleep` with context cancellation and timers

**Potential Impact**: 2-3x throughput improvement, reduced latency variance

## 3. I/O Performance Issues

### Critical Problems:
- **Minimal Connection Pooling** ([`client/http_client.go:14`](internal/client/http_client.go:14)): Fixed `MaxIdleConnsPerHost: 10` insufficient for high concurrency
- **No Connection Reuse Optimization**: Missing keep-alive tuning and DNS caching
- **Double I/O Operations**: Non-streaming responses read body twice ([`proxy_handler.go:130,170`](internal/proxy_handler.go:130))

### Optimization Opportunities:
1. **Enhanced Connection Pooling**:
   ```go
   transport := &http.Transport{
       MaxIdleConns:        200,
       MaxIdleConnsPerHost: 50,
       MaxConnsPerHost:     100,
       IdleConnTimeout:     90 * time.Second,
       DisableKeepAlives:   false,
   }
   ```

2. **HTTP/2 Support**: Enable HTTP/2 for providers that support it
3. **Request Pipelining**: Batch multiple requests where API supports it

**Potential Impact**: 40-60% latency reduction, 2x concurrent request capacity

## 4. CPU-Intensive Operations

### Critical Problems:
- **Redundant JSON Operations** ([`gemini/client.go:113,155`](internal/gemini/client.go:113)): Multiple marshal/unmarshal cycles per request
- **Inefficient Model Selection** ([`proxy_handler.go:217-254`](internal/proxy_handler.go:217)): O(n) linear search through models repeatedly
- **String Processing Overhead** ([`proxy_handler.go:417-425`](internal/proxy_handler.go:417)): Multiple string operations on response content

### Optimization Opportunities:
1. **Model Selection Optimization**:
   ```go
   // Pre-compute eligible models by size category
   type ModelIndex struct {
       smallModels map[int][]*Model  // keyed by max length
       bigModels   map[int][]*Model
   }
   ```

2. **GJSON/SJSON Optimization**: Use direct byte operations instead of string conversions
3. **Response Template Caching**: Pre-compile response structures for common patterns

**Potential Impact**: 25-35% CPU reduction, faster response processing

## 5. Resource Management Issues

### Critical Problems:
- **Missing Context Propagation** ([`schema/schema.go:34`](internal/schema/schema.go:34)): Provider interface doesn't use context for cancellation
- **Improper Connection Lifecycle**: No explicit connection closure or timeout handling
- **Memory Leaks in Error Paths**: Response bodies not always properly closed

### Optimization Opportunities:
1. **Context-Aware Operations**:
   ```go
   type Provider interface {
       Call(ctx context.Context, payload []byte, path string) ([]byte, error)
       Close() error  // Explicit resource cleanup
   }
   ```

2. **Resource Pooling**: Implement connection pools per provider with proper lifecycle management
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Circuit breaker pattern for failing providers

**Potential Impact**: Improved stability, reduced resource leaks, better error handling

## Priority Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1 (High Impact, Low Risk)
1. **Connection Pool Optimization** - Immediate 40% latency improvement
2. **Buffer Pooling with sync.Pool** - 30% memory reduction
3. **Remove Global Queue Serialization** - 2x throughput increase

### Phase 2 (High Impact, Medium Risk)
1. **Model Selection Index** - 25% CPU reduction
2. **Streaming Response Optimization** - Eliminate double I/O
3. **Context-Based Cancellation** - Better resource management

### Phase 3 (Medium Impact, Low Risk)
1. **JSON Decoder Pooling** - Reduced allocation pressure
2. **HTTP/2 Support** - Protocol-level optimizations
3. **Metrics and Monitoring** - Performance visibility

## Quantified Performance Expectations

Based on similar optimization patterns:
- **Latency**: 50-70% reduction (P95)
- **Throughput**: 3-4x increase in concurrent requests
- **Memory Usage**: 40-50% reduction in heap allocation
- **CPU Utilization**: 30-40% reduction under load
- **Error Rate**: 60% reduction due to better resource management

These optimizations maintain code readability while significantly improving performance characteristics, following Go best practices and the existing architecture patterns.

[new_task completed] Result: # AI Proxy Security Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The AI proxy codebase contains multiple **CRITICAL** and **HIGH** severity security vulnerabilities that require immediate attention. The most concerning issues include hard-coded authentication tokens, extensive data leakage through logging, lack of proper input validation, and insufficient network security controls.

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. Hard-coded Authentication Token (CRITICAL)
**File:** [`main.go:28`](main.go:28)
**Issue:** Hard-coded Base64 authentication token in source code
```go
if req.Header.Get("Authorization") != "Bearer QVBJIFRPS0VOIEZPUiBBSS1QUk9YWQ==" {
```
**Impact:** Anyone with access to source code can bypass authentication
**Remediation:** 
- Move authentication token to environment variables
- Implement proper token management with rotation
- Use secure token generation and validation

### 2. Authentication Middleware Disabled (CRITICAL)
**File:** [`main.go:105`](main.go:105)
**Issue:** Authentication middleware is commented out, allowing unauthenticated access
```go
// mux.HandleFunc("/", authMiddleware(handleHTTP))
```
**Impact:** Complete bypass of authentication system
**Remediation:** Enable authentication middleware and apply to all sensitive endpoints

### 3. Sensitive Data Logging (HIGH)
**Files:** Multiple locations including [`internal/proxy_handler.go:324`](internal/proxy_handler.go:324), [`internal/proxy_handler.go:187`](internal/proxy_handler.go:187)
**Issue:** API tokens, request content, and response data logged in plain text
```go
log.Printf("Request to model: %s - %s\n", modelName, printFirstChars(gjson.GetBytes(requestBody, "messages.0.content").String()))
log.Printf("ERROR: %s, body: %s\n", err, string(resp))
```
**Impact:** Credential theft, data exposure in logs
**Remediation:** 
- Sanitize all log outputs
- Redact sensitive information (tokens, user content)
- Implement structured logging with sensitivity levels

### 4. Race Conditions in Rate Limiting (HIGH)
**File:** [`internal/proxy_handler.go:227-253`](internal/proxy_handler.go:227-253)
**Issue:** Race conditions in rate limit checking and selection logic
**Impact:** Rate limit bypass, potential DoS
**Remediation:** 
- Fix race conditions in [`selectModel()`](internal/proxy_handler.go:212) function
- Use atomic operations for counters
- Implement proper locking strategy

## High Severity Issues

### 5. Missing TLS Security Configuration (HIGH)
**File:** [`internal/client/http_client.go:13`](internal/client/http_client.go:13)
**Issue:** No TLS certificate validation or security settings configured
**Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, certificate bypass
**Remediation:** 
```go
transport := &http.Transport{
    TLSClientConfig: &tls.Config{
        InsecureSkipVerify: false,
        MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS12,
    },
    MaxIdleConns: 100,
    // ... other settings
}
```

### 6. Insufficient Input Validation (HIGH)
**File:** [`internal/proxy_handler.go:79`](internal/proxy_handler.go:79)
**Issue:** Only basic JSON validation, no comprehensive input sanitization
**Impact:** JSON injection, oversized requests, malformed data processing
**Remediation:**
- Implement request size limits
- Add comprehensive input validation
- Sanitize all user inputs before processing

### 7. SSRF Vulnerability (HIGH)
**Files:** All provider clients allow arbitrary URL access
**Issue:** No validation of provider URLs, potential for SSRF attacks
**Impact:** Internal network access, data exfiltration
**Remediation:**
- Implement URL allowlisting
- Validate all external URLs
- Use network segmentation

### 8. Insecure Configuration Management (HIGH)
**File:** [`main.go:17-18`](main.go:17-18)
**Issue:** Configuration with sensitive data embedded in binary
**Impact:** Credential exposure in compiled binaries
**Remediation:**
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement configuration encryption
- Support external configuration files with proper permissions

## Medium Severity Issues

### 9. Information Disclosure in Error Messages (MEDIUM)
**Multiple files:** Detailed error messages expose internal system structure
**Remediation:** Implement generic error responses for external clients

### 10. Missing Request Size Limits (MEDIUM)
**File:** [`internal/proxy_handler.go:71`](internal/proxy_handler.go:71)
**Issue:** No limits on request body size
**Remediation:** Implement configurable request size limits

### 11. Dependency Security Concerns (MEDIUM)
**File:** [`go.mod`](go.mod)
**Issue:** Pre-release dependency versions and no automated vulnerability scanning
**Remediation:**
- Pin to stable release versions
- Implement automated dependency scanning
- Regular security updates

## Low Severity Issues

### 12. Inadequate Error Recovery (LOW)
**Issue:** Limited error recovery mechanisms
**Remediation:** Implement graceful degradation and circuit breaker patterns

### 13. Missing Security Headers (LOW)
**Issue:** No security headers in HTTP responses
**Remediation:** Add appropriate security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

## Immediate Action Required

### Priority 1 (Fix within 24 hours):
1. Remove hard-coded authentication token
2. Enable authentication middleware
3. Stop logging sensitive data
4. Fix rate limiting race conditions

### Priority 2 (Fix within 1 week):
1. Implement proper TLS configuration
2. Add comprehensive input validation
3. Secure configuration management
4. Implement SSRF protections

### Priority 3 (Fix within 2 weeks):
1. Sanitize error messages
2. Add request size limits
3. Update dependencies
4. Implement security headers

## Security Best Practices Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization:
```go
// Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
func getAuthToken() string {
    token := os.Getenv("AUTH_TOKEN")
    if token == "" {
        log.Fatal("AUTH_TOKEN environment variable required")
    }
    return token
}
```

### Secure Logging:
```go
// Sanitize sensitive data in logs
func sanitizeLogData(data string) string {
    // Redact tokens, API keys, and user content
    return redactSensitiveInfo(data)
}
```

### Input Validation:
```go
// Add request size limits and validation
const maxRequestSize = 10 << 20 // 10MB
http.MaxBytesReader(w, req.Body, maxRequestSize)
```

This security analysis reveals significant vulnerabilities requiring immediate remediation to secure the AI proxy system. The combination of authentication bypass, data leakage, and network security issues creates a high-risk environment that must be addressed urgently.

[new_task completed] Result: # Go-Specific Optimization Analysis: AI Proxy Codebase

## Executive Summary

The AI proxy codebase demonstrates good Go fundamentals but has several optimization opportunities across memory management, concurrency patterns, and standard library usage. Key findings include inefficient slice operations, repeated throttling patterns, missing benchmark infrastructure, and opportunities for better memory alignment and allocation patterns.

## 1. Memory Management Patterns

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues

**Slice Growth Inefficiency** - [`main.go:90-92`](main.go:90)
```go
// Current: O(nÂ²) growth pattern
internal.Models = append(internal.Models, v)

// Optimized: Pre-allocate capacity
internal.Models = make([]internal.Model, 0, len(config.Models))
for _, v := range config.Models {
    internal.Models = append(internal.Models, v)
}
```

**Memory Allocation in Hot Path** - [`internal/proxy_handler.go:320-430`](internal/proxy_handler.go:320)
```go
// Current: Repeated allocations
reader := bytes.NewReader(resp)
return io.NopCloser(reader), false, nil

// Optimized: Use sync.Pool
var readerPool = sync.Pool{
    New: func() interface{} { return &bytes.Reader{} },
}

func getReader(data []byte) io.ReadCloser {
    reader := readerPool.Get().(*bytes.Reader)
    reader.Reset(data)
    return &pooledReadCloser{reader: reader}
}
```

### ðŸŸ¡ Moderate Issues

**Struct Field Ordering** - [`internal/proxy_handler.go:27-36`](internal/proxy_handler.go:27)
```go
// Current: Poor memory alignment (40 bytes on 64-bit)
type RateLimit struct {
    minuteCount int      // 8 bytes
    hourCount   int      // 8 bytes  
    dayCount    int      // 8 bytes
    lastMinute  time.Time // 24 bytes
    lastHour    time.Time // 24 bytes
    lastDay     time.Time // 24 bytes
    lastRequest time.Time // 24 bytes
    mux         sync.Mutex // 8 bytes
}

// Optimized: Better alignment (32 bytes on 64-bit)
type RateLimit struct {
    lastMinute  time.Time // 24 bytes
    lastHour    time.Time // 24 bytes  
    lastDay     time.Time // 24 bytes
    lastRequest time.Time // 24 bytes
    minuteCount int       // 8 bytes
    hourCount   int       // 8 bytes
    dayCount    int       // 8 bytes
    mux         sync.Mutex // 8 bytes
}
```

## 2. Goroutine and Channel Patterns

### ðŸ”´ Critical Anti-Pattern: Channel-as-Mutex

**Multiple Providers** - [`internal/gemini/client.go:18-19`](internal/gemini/client.go:18), [`internal/groq/client.go:17-18`](internal/groq/client.go:17), [`internal/cloudflare/client.go:17-18`](internal/cloudflare/client.go:17)
```go
// Current: Anti-pattern across all providers
var (
    queue           = make(chan interface{}, 1) // Channel as mutex
    lastTimeRequest = time.Now()
)

// Usage pattern:
queue <- struct{}{}
defer func() {
    lastTimeRequest = time.Now()
    <-queue
}()

// Optimized: Proper sync primitives
type ThrottledClient struct {
    mu              sync.Mutex
    lastRequest     time.Time
    minInterval     time.Duration
}

func (tc *ThrottledClient) Wait() {
    tc.mu.Lock()
    defer tc.mu.Unlock()
    
    elapsed := time.Since(tc.lastRequest)
    if elapsed < tc.minInterval {
        time.Sleep(tc.minInterval - elapsed)
    }
    tc.lastRequest = time.Now()
}
```

### ðŸŸ¡ Missing Context Cancellation

**HTTP Requests** - [`internal/gemini/client.go:137-142`](internal/gemini/client.go:137)
```go
// Current: No context timeout
resp, err := c.httpClient.Do(req)

// Optimized: Use context with timeout
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 30*time.Second)
defer cancel()
req = req.WithContext(ctx)
resp, err := c.httpClient.Do(req)
```

## 3. Interface Usage and Polymorphism

### ðŸŸ¢ Good Pattern: Provider Interface

**Well-Designed Interface** - [`internal/schema/schema.go:32-35`](internal/schema/schema.go:32)
```go
type Provider interface {
    Call(ctx context.Context, payload []byte, path string) ([]byte, error)
}
```

### ðŸŸ¡ Missing Stream Interface

**Streaming Support** - [`internal/openrouter/client.go:142-144`](internal/openrouter/client.go:142)
```go
// Current: Separate streaming method
func (c *OpenRouterClient) StreamCall(requestBody []byte) (io.ReadCloser, error)

// Optimized: Extended interface
type StreamProvider interface {
    Provider
    StreamCall(ctx context.Context, payload []byte) (io.ReadCloser, error)
}
```

## 4. Standard Library Optimization

### ðŸ”´ HTTP Client Misuse

**Hardcoded Default Client** - [`internal/image.go:119`](internal/image.go:119)
```go
// Current: Uses default client
resp, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)

// Should use: Configured client from centralized factory
resp, err := client.NewHttpClient(model.HttpClientConfig).Do(req)
```

### ðŸŸ¡ JSON Processing Optimization

**Repeated Marshal/Unmarshal** - [`internal/proxy_handler.go:324`](internal/proxy_handler.go:324)
```go
// Current: Direct GJSON usage is good, but could be optimized further
content := gjson.GetBytes(resp, "choices.0.message.content").String()

// Consider: Pre-parsing frequently accessed paths
type CachedJSONPath struct {
    path gjson.Result
}

var commonPaths = struct {
    content gjson.Result
}{
    content: gjson.Get("", "choices.0.message.content"),
}
```

### ðŸŸ¡ String Operations

**String Concatenation** - [`internal/gemini/client.go:105`](internal/gemini/client.go:105)
```go
// Current: String concatenation
providerURL = fmt.Sprintf("%s/%s:generateContent?key=%s", providerURL, model, token)

// Optimized: strings.Builder for multiple operations
var builder strings.Builder
builder.WriteString(providerURL)
builder.WriteString("/")
builder.WriteString(model)
builder.WriteString(":generateContent?key=")
builder.WriteString(token)
return builder.String()
```

## 5. Error Handling Patterns

### ðŸŸ¢ Good Error Wrapping

**Proper Error Context** - [`internal/openai/client.go:19`](internal/openai/client.go:19)
```go
return nil, fmt.Errorf("error in sjson.SetBytes: %w", err)
```

### ðŸŸ¡ Hot Path Error Handling

**Rate Limiting Check** - [`internal/proxy_handler.go:227-254`](internal/proxy_handler.go:227)
```go
// Current: Repeated map lookups and locking
limit := RateLimits[model.Name]
limit.mux.Lock()
if limit.minuteCount < model.RequestsPerMin && ...

// Optimized: Reduce lock contention
func (rl *RateLimit) CheckLimits(model Model) bool {
    rl.mux.RLock()
    defer rl.mux.RUnlock()
    
    now := time.Now()
    rl.updateCounters(now) // Separate method
    
    return rl.minuteCount < model.RequestsPerMin &&
           rl.hourCount < model.RequestsPerHour &&
           rl.dayCount < model.RequestsPerDay
}
```

## 6. Build and Compiler Optimization

### ðŸŸ¡ Missing Compiler Hints

**Hot Functions** - [`internal/proxy_handler.go:212-261`](internal/proxy_handler.go:212)
```go
// Add compiler hints for hot path functions
//go:noinline
func selectModel(modelSize string, requestLength int) string {
    // Critical path - prevent inlining for better profiling
}

//go:nosplit
func incrementRateLimit(modelName string) {
    // Hot path - reduce stack checking overhead
}
```

### ðŸŸ¡ Build Constraints

**Missing Environment-Specific Builds**
```go
// Add build constraints for different environments
//go:build production
// +build production

// Optimized production code with reduced logging

//go:build debug  
// +build debug

// Debug builds with verbose logging
```

## 7. Testing and Benchmarking Patterns

### ðŸ”´ Missing Test Infrastructure

**No Tests Found** - Critical gap in codebase
```go
// Required: Basic benchmark structure
func BenchmarkSelectModel(b *testing.B) {
    // Setup models
    models := setupTestModels()
    
    b.ResetTimer()
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        selectModel("SMALL", 1000)
    }
}

func BenchmarkRateLimitCheck(b *testing.B) {
    rl := &RateLimit{}
    model := Model{RequestsPerMin: 100}
    
    b.ResetTimer()
    b.RunParallel(func(pb *testing.PB) {
        for pb.Next() {
            rl.CheckLimits(model)
        }
    })
}
```

### ðŸ”´ Missing Profiling Integration

**Add Profiling Endpoints**
```go
// Add to main.go
import _ "net/http/pprof"

func main() {
    // Add debug endpoints
    go func() {
        log.Println("Profiling server started on :6060")
        log.Println(http.ListenAndServe(":6060", nil))
    }()
    
    // Existing code...
}
```

## 8. Go-specific Anti-patterns

### ðŸ”´ Global State Management

**Multiple Global Variables** - [`internal/proxy_handler.go:52-55`](internal/proxy_handler.go:52)
```go
// Current: Global state
var (
    RateLimits map[string]*RateLimit
    Models     []Model  
)

// Optimized: Dependency injection
type ProxyService struct {
    rateLimits map[string]*RateLimit
    models     []Model
    mu         sync.RWMutex
}

func NewProxyService(models []Model) *ProxyService {
    rateLimits := make(map[string]*RateLimit, len(models))
    for _, model := range models {
        rateLimits[model.Name] = &RateLimit{}
    }
    
    return &ProxyService{
        rateLimits: rateLimits,
        models:     models,
    }
}
```

### ðŸ”´ Repeated Code Patterns

**Provider Throttling Code Duplication**
```go
// Create shared throttling component
type ProviderThrottler struct {
    mu              sync.Mutex
    lastRequest     time.Time
    minInterval     time.Duration
    providerName    string
}

func NewProviderThrottler(interval time.Duration, name string) *ProviderThrottler {
    return &ProviderThrottler{
        minInterval:  interval,
        providerName: name,
    }
}

func (pt *ProviderThrottler) Wait(ctx context.Context) error {
    pt.mu.Lock()
    defer pt.mu.Unlock()
    
    elapsed := time.Since(pt.lastRequest)
    if elapsed < pt.minInterval {
        waitTime := pt.minInterval - elapsed
        log.Printf("Throttled %v seconds for %s", waitTime.Seconds(), pt.providerName)
        
        select {
        case <-time.After(waitTime):
        case <-ctx.Done():
            return ctx.Err()
        }
    }
    
    pt.lastRequest = time.Now()
    return nil
}
```

**Assistant:**

Of course. I will save the comprehensive analysis and the optimization plan to the memory bank. This will ensure that all the insights we've gathered are preserved for future work on this project.

I will update the following files in the `.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/` directory:
*   `architecture.md`: To include the detailed architectural patterns and insights from the analysis.
*   `tech.md`: To incorporate the Go-specific best practices and identified anti-patterns.
*   `context.md`: To reflect that the analysis is complete and an optimization plan is ready for implementation.
*   I will also create a new file, `optimization-plan.md`, to store the detailed, prioritized plan.

I will proceed with updating these files now, starting with `architecture.md`.

**User:**

[new_task completed] Result: I've successfully fixed the Mermaid diagram in the `.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/architecture.md` file. The diagram now has proper syntax and should render correctly without parsing errors. The key fixes were:

1. Removed the extra semicolon at the end of classDef lines
2. Restructured the class definitions to use the correct Mermaid syntax
3. Maintained the same architectural flow showing:
   - Client requests to Proxy API Handler
   - Model selection decision (category vs specific)
   - Model Router for category-based selection
   - Rate Limiter Check for limit validation
   - Provider Client for external API calls
   - Response handling for both streaming and buffered responses
   - Error handling paths

The diagram correctly shows the top-down flow with proper decision points and component relationships. All the detailed component roles, architecture patterns, and implementation details remain intact and unchanged.

**Assistant:**

### Context

1. **Previous Conversation:**
   - The conversation has focused on optimizing an AI-proxy server written in Go, with an emphasis on performance and security improvements.
   - The analysis was conducted in four phases: codebase structure, performance optimization, security vulnerabilities, and Go-specific best practices.
   - Key tasks included identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities, optimizing performance, and ensuring adherence to Go best practices.
   - The user provided specific instructions to update the `.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/architecture.md` file to incorporate findings from the "AI Proxy Codebase Architecture Analysis" task.

2. **Current Work:**
   - The current task involves updating the `.kilocore/rules/memory-bank/architecture.md` file.
   - Instructions include reading the existing content, incorporating findings from the architecture analysis, keeping the Mermaid diagram, expanding the "Component Roles" section, and adding new sections for "Architecture Patterns" and "Key Implementation Details."
   - The goal is to create a comprehensive and up-to-date representation of the system's architecture.

3. **Key Technical Concepts:**
   - **Performance Optimization:** Memory allocation, concurrency, I/O efficiency, CPU usage.
   - **Security:** Authentication, data protection, network security, input validation.
   - **Go Best Practices:** Proper use of Go idioms, memory management, error handling.
   - **Architecture Patterns:** Plugin, Factory, Strategy, Circuit Breaker.
   - **Implementation Details:** Concurrency, Performance, Resource Management.

4. **Relevant Files and Code:**
   - `.kilocore/rules/memory-bank/architecture.md`: The file being updated to include detailed architectural patterns, component roles, and implementation details. The Mermaid diagram in this file was fixed for proper syntax and rendering.

5. **Problem Solving:**
   - Fixed Mermaid diagram syntax issues in the architecture.md file, ensuring proper rendering and flow representation.
   - Ensured the diagram accurately reflects the architectural flow, including decision points and component relationships.

6. **Pending Tasks and Next Steps:**
   - Complete the update of `.kilocore/rules/memory-bank/architecture.md` by:
     - Expanding the "Component Roles" section with detailed analysis of each component (Proxy API, Model Router, Rate Limiter, Provider Adapter).
     - Adding new sections for "Architecture Patterns" (Plugin, Factory, Strategy, Circuit Breaker) and "Key Implementation Details" (Concurrency, Performance, Resource Management).
   - Signal completion using the `attempt_completion` tool with a concise summary of the outcome.

This summary captures the essential details of the conversation, ensuring continuity and clarity for further tasks.
