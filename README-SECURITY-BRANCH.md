# Security Fix Branch - `fix/secret-leakage-security`

## Purpose

This branch was created to address SonarQube warnings and git warnings related to secret leakage in the AI Proxy project. The branch will be used to implement the secret leakage mitigation plan that has been developed.

## Planned Security Improvements

1. **Hard-coded Authentication Token Removal**
   - Remove hard-coded Base64 authentication token from source code
   - Implement proper token management with environment variables

2. **Authentication Middleware Re-enabling**
   - Re-enable the commented-out authentication middleware
   - Ensure proper configuration and application to all sensitive endpoints

3. **Sensitive Data Logging Fixes**
   - Sanitize all log outputs to prevent credential theft and data exposure
   - Redact sensitive information (tokens, user content) from logs

4. **Race Condition Fixes in Rate Limiting**
   - Address race conditions in rate limit checking and selection logic
   - Implement proper locking strategy with atomic operations

5. **Additional Security Enhancements**
   - Implement proper TLS configuration with certificate validation
   - Add comprehensive input validation and sanitization
   - Implement URL allowlisting to prevent SSRF vulnerabilities
   - Secure configuration management using environment variables

- Branch purpose documented: ✅
- Push to remote: Pending (Authentication required)

## Next Steps

To push this branch to the remote repository:
1. Configure git credentials for HTTPS authentication, or
2. Set up SSH keys for SSH authentication, or
3. Use a personal access token for authentication

Example commands for pushing:
```bash
# For HTTPS with personal access token
git push origin fix/secret-leakage-security

# For SSH (after setting up SSH keys)
git push origin fix/secret-leakage-security
