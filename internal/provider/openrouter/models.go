// This file is reserved for OpenRouter-specific constants or structs.
//
// Currently, OpenRouter uses standard OpenAI-compatible models, so no
// special constants or structs are needed. However, this file exists to
// maintain consistency with other providers and to allow for future
// extensions if needed.
